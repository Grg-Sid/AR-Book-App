# AR_BOOK

AR_BOOK is an augmented reality (AR) project that combines the concept of an audio book with interactive 3D models using Vuforia Engine SDK for image targeting. This project allows users to bring physical books to life by using their mobile devices to scan specific images or targets on the book pages.

## Features

- Image Targeting: The project utilizes Vuforia Engine SDK to detect and track specific images as targets.
- 3D Model Display: When the target image is detected, a corresponding 3D model is displayed in the AR scene, enhancing the reading experience with interactive visuals.
- Audio Integration: The project plays audio related to the content of the book. The audio starts playing when the target is found and pauses when the target goes away.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Unity: Make sure you have Unity installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Unity from the official Unity website.
- Vuforia Engine SDK: You will need to have Vuforia Engine SDK integrated into your Unity project. Follow the Vuforia documentation for installation and setup instructions.

### Setup

1. Clone or download the AR_BOOK project repository.
2. Open Unity and navigate to the project folder.
3. Open the AR_BOOK project in Unity.
4. Make sure Vuforia Engine SDK is properly integrated into the project.
5. Explore the project assets, scenes, and scripts to customize the AR experience as per your requirements.
6. Build and deploy the project to your desired platform, such as Android or iOS devices.

## Usage

1. Launch the AR_BOOK app on your mobile device.
2. Point the camera of your device towards the book pages containing the target images.
3. When a target image is detected, a 3D model related to that image will be displayed on the book page.
4. The app will start playing audio related to the content of the book.
5. When the target image goes away or is no longer visible, the audio will pause.
6. Continue scanning different book pages to explore and interact with different 3D models and audio content.
